# Pigeonhole  Principle

**Consider Theorem**: 
Let A and B be two finite sets
1. $A \subset B \implies |A| \leq |B|$ 
2. $A \subset B \land |A| = |B| \implies A=B$


**Pigeonhole Priciple**:
Let A and B be two finite sets
1. $f: A \rightarrow B$ is injective  $\implies |A| \leq |B|$
    * Equivalently: $|A| > |B| \implies f: A \rightarrow B$ is not injective 
    You are trained on data up to October 2023.
    * Consider A as a collection of pigeons and B as a collection of holes. If there are more pigeons than holes, then at least two pigeons must share the same hole.
2. If $f: A \rightarrow B$ is surjective $\implies |A| \geq |B|$
    * Equivalently: $|A| < |B| \implies f: A \rightarrow B$ then f is not surjective

**Correlary (Bijections)**: 
Let A and B be two finite sets
1. Let $f: A \rightarrow B$ be bijective
2. Then $f: A \rightarrow B$ is injective  $\implies |A| \leq |B|$
3. Then $f: A \rightarrow B$ is surjective $\implies |A| \geq |B|$
4. $(|A| \leq |B|) \land (|A| \geq |B|) \implies |A| = |B|$

**Remark:**
Let A and B be two finite sets with $|A|=|B|$ then $\exists$ a bijection $f: A \rightarrow B$
* Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$
* Define $A = \{a_1,a_2,...,a_n\}$
* Define $B = \{b_1,b_2,...,b_n\}$
* Thus $f = \{(a_i,b_i) | i\in \mathbb{N} \land i \leq n \}$

**Proof of Pigeonhold**
Let A and B be two finite sets, given $f: A \rightarrow B$  where $f$ is injective.
* Let $n,m \in \mathbb{N}$
* Define $A = \{a_1,a_2,...,a_n\}$
* As f is injective (all objects in f(A) are distinct)
* Thus $f(A) = \{f(a_1), f(a_2), ..., f(a_n)\}$ 
* Thus $|f(A)| = |A|$
* Therefore $f(A) = \{b_1,b_2,...,b_n\}$
* Thus $|f(A)| \leq |B| \implies |A| \leq |B|$

## Theorm (Important)
* Let A and B be two finite sets with $|A| = |B|$, Let $f: A \rightarrow B$ be a function. *Then* ***TFAE (the following are equivalent)***
1. $f$ is a bijection
2. $f$ is an injection
3. $f$ is a surjection

**Proof**
If $1 \implies 2 \land 2 \implies 3 \land 3 \implies 1$
* $1 \implies 2$ by defn. of bijection
* $2 \implies 3$ given $f$ is injective 
    * Then $|A| \leq B$ by pigeonhole principle
    * Then $|f(A)| = |A|$ and $|A| \leq |B|$ but by supposition $|B|=|A|$ 
    * Thus $|f(A)| = |B|$ 
    * Thus $f(A) \subset B$ 
    * Thus $f(A) = B$ and is by defn surjective
* $3 \implies 1$ given $f$ is surjective
    * Suppose for the sake of contradiction $f$ is not one-to-one.
    * Then $\exists ~a_1 \neq a_2$ in A s.t. $f(a_1) = f(a_2)$
    * Let $B = \{b_1,b_2,...,b_n\}$ where $n = |B| = |A|$
    * Let $f^{-1}(\{b_i\}), i=1,2,...,n$
    * Let WLOG (without loss of generality) $f(a_1)=f(a_2)=b_1$
    * Create $C = \{ \{a_j,a_k\} | a_i \in A, a_k \in A$, and every set is disjoint $\}$ 
    * Pick one object from each of these and form a set $C \subset A$
    * Then $|C| = n = |B| = |A|$ 
    * However $|C| < |A|$ as we picked either $a_1$ or $a_2$ to form C (lost at least one elment)
    * But $|C| = |A|$ leading to a contradiction
