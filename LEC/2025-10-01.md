# Relations 

A relation is a *set* of *ordered pairts*

Notation: 
* R is relation.
* If $(a_c.b) \in R$, we say that $a$ is related to $b$
* and write $aRb$

A *relation* on a set A is a *subset of AxA*

A relation from A to B, where A and B are sets, is a subset of A x B

## Examples:

R = {(1,2)}

Here 1R2

R = {(2,1)}

Here 2R1

---

R = {(1,1),(2,2)}

Here, 1R1 and 2R2.

$$R = \{(a,b) | \text{a and b are people with same last name} \}$$

Here, aRa, also aRb => bRa (reflexive)

aRb, bRc => aRc (transitive)

Define a relation on $\mathbb{R}$ as follows: 

$$R = \{ (a,b) | a,b \in \mathbb{R},  a+b = 0  \} \subset \mathbb{R}x\mathbb{R}$$ 

Observe is equal to 

$$R = \{(a,-a)|a\in\mathbb{R}\}$$

Note: $(1,1) \not \in R$

Written as: $1 \neg{R} 1$

# Inverse Relations
If R is a relation we define $R^{-1} = \{(a,b) | (b,c) \in R\}$  

## Example 

$$R = \{(1,2),(1,3)\}$$

Then 1R2, 1R3

$$R^{-1} = \{(2,1),(3,1)\}$$

Then 2R1, 3R1

# Special Relations 

Let R be a relation on a set A: $R \subset AxA$

Then: 
## Reflexive
$R$ is called a reflexive iff $aRa \forall a \in A$

* This means $(a,a) \in R, \forall a \in A$
* Example:
    * on $\mathbb{R}, R = \{(a,a)|a\in\mathbb{R}\}$ is relexive
    * on $R = \{(1,2),(1,3)\}$ is not relexive on A={1,2,3}

## Symmetric
$R$ is symmetric iff $aRb \implies bRa$ when $a,b \in A$
* This means $(a,a) \in R \implies (b,a) \in R, \forall a \in A$
    * Example $A = \{1,2,3\}$
    * $R = \{(1,2), (1,3), (2,1)\}$, thus R is not symmetric for (1,3) as (3,1) is not in R
    * on $\mathbb{R}, R = \{(a,a)|a\in\mathbb{R}\}$ is relexive and symmetric

## Antisymetric
Note Antisymetric is NOT the opposite of symmetric

$R$ is antisymetric iff $aRb \land bRa \implies a=b$ 
* Example
    * On $A = \{1,2\}$, $R=\{(1,2)\}$ is antisymetric, vaccously true
    * On $\mathbb{R}$ say aRb if $a \leq b$
        * So $R = \{(a,b) | a \leq b\}$
        * Thus, $aRb \land bRa \implies a \leq b \land b \leq a \implies a=b$
        * Therefore this R is antisymetric 
    * On $R = \{(a,b) | a=b\}$ is a relation on R 
        * R is reflexive 
        * R is symetric 
        * R is antisymetric
## Transitive 
$R$ is transitive iff $aRb \land bRc \implies aRc$ 
* Example 
    * On $A = \{1,2,3\}$, $R=\{(1,2)\}$, thus is transitive by vaccous truth
    * On $A = \{1,2,3\}$, $R=\{(1,2), (2,3)\}$, thus is NOT transitive 
    * On $A = \{1,2,3\}$, $R=\{(1,2), (2,3), (1,3)\}$, thus is transitive
