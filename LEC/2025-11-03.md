# The Strong PMI

Let P(n) denote a statement involving $n \in \mathbb{N}$

Suppose:

* $P(1)$ is true
* $P(1),P(2),...,P(k) \implies P(k+1)$ 

Then $P(n)$ is true $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}$

## Example: 

Motivation: Any natural number is the sum of distinct powers of two.

$P(n):$ is the sum of distinct powers of two.

$P(1): 1=2^0$

Suppose $P(1), P(2), ...,  P(k)$ are true, such that each term is equal to a sum of distinct powers of two.

Look at $k+1$:
* write $k+1 = 2m
    * Then m = sumpowers of distincy powers of two

$k+1 = 2m + 1 (sum) + 2^0$

This shows that 

$P(1) \land P(2) \land ... \land P(k) \implies P(k+1)$ By strong PMI, Then $P(n)$ is true $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}$

## Example: 

Motivation: 

Recall: a number is prime if n>1 and it's only divisors are itself and 1

Recall: a number is composite if n>1 and n is not a prime

$\mathbb{N}:$
* 1
* 2 prime
* 3 prime 
* 4 composite  = 2 prime * 2 prime (product of primes)
* 5 prime
* 6 composite  = 3 * 2
* 7 prime
* 8 composite = 4 * 2 = (2 * 2) * 2

$P(n):$ every natural number is either 1, prime, or a product of primes.

P(1): 1=1
P(2): 2 is prime
P(4): 4 = 2 * 2

Suppose P(1),P(2),...,P(k) is true

If k+1 is prime then P(k+1) is true

If k+1 is not prime then observe k+1 = m*l, where m,l are natural numbers.
* clearly, m and l are <= k therefore P(m) and P(1) are both true
    * Therefore k+1 is a product of primes, P(k+1) is true
