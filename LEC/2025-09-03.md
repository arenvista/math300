* Axiomatic System consists of: 
    - Some undefn. terms 
    - Rules (Axioms) 
* Set Theory (Naive)
    - A collection of well defined objects.
    - Sets are defined by capital letters
        - Elements of a set are defn. by lower-case letters
    - $a \in A$ or $b \not\in A$
    - Two ways of writing a set: 
        - $\{\text{list all objects...} \}$
        - $A=\{xx|yy\} \leftrightarrow A=\{xx:yy\}$
            - all x's where y is satisfied

In the usual number system: 
* $\mathbb{R}$ the set of all real numbers
* $\mathbb{Q}$ the set of all rational numbers $\{ \dfrac{m}{n} | m,n \in Z\}$
* $\mathbb{Z}$ the set of all positive integers (neq 0) $\{0, 1, -1, 2, -2, ...\}$
* $\mathbb{N}$ the set of all integers $\{1 , 2, 3, 4, ...\}$

In $\mathbb{R}$ we add, multiply, divide, and subtract in the usual way.
    - Ex. 1+1 = 2

An *unusual* number system: 
* In this system, there are two objects: 0, 1

Introduce Addition In the Following Way:

| + | 1 | 0 |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 |

`Note: 1+1 = 0` 

How to create this system: 
* Start w/ $\mathbb{Z} = \{0, 1, -1, 2, -2, ...\}$
* Divide any integer by 2 and look at the **reminder**:
    - 3 % 2 =  1 
    - 6 % 2 = 0 
    - -7 % 2 = 1
        * Observe the remainders are always either 0 || 1 
        * Collect these and form a set
            * $\mathbb{Z}_2 = \{0,1\}$ (base is 2)

How to add two objects in $\mathbb{Z}_2$
* Call these numbers $a$ and $b$ add them in the usual way; divide this sum by 2 and return the remainder 

The remainder: this last number (remainder) is the sum of $a$ and $b$ in $\mathbb{Z}_2$

Ex. 
* $0+1 = 1 \% 2 = 1$
* $1+1 = 2 \% 2 = 0$

Addition Table for Z_3

| + | 0 | 1 | 2 |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 2 |
| 1 | 1 | 2 | 0 |
| 2 | 2 | 0 | 1 |

# How to Write Natural Numbers in $\mathbb{Z}_2$
$13 = 1E1 + 3E0$ 

In terms of $\mathbb{Z_2}$:
* $13 = 8 + 4 + 1 = 1(2^3)+ 1(2^2) + 0(2^1) + 1(2^0)$

# Mathematical Logic and Grammar 
* Say not "a number squared is 4" rather say $\exists x \in \mathbb{R} \rightarrow x^2 = 4$
