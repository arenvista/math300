Given P=>Q the statement Q=>P is called the converse 

The statement ~Q => ~P is called the contra-positive

Theorem/Proposition is a declarative statement that can be justified by logically correct arguments - by giving a 'proof'.

Lemma is a proposition or a that is used in the course of a proof.

Corollary to a proposition is a consquence.

Usually, a theorem/proposition is of the form H => C, where H is hypothesis and C is the conclusion.

# Example 1 

Let a and b be two real numbers s.t. a*b=0; then $(a+b)^2 = a^2 + b^2$


* H: a and b be two real numbers s.t. a*b=0
* C: $(a+b)^2 = a^2 + b^2$

Proof: 
* $(a+b)^2 = (a+b)(a+b) = 2ab + a^2 +b^2$
* Observe ab=0, thus $(a+b)^2 = 2(0) + a^2 +b^2$ = $a^2 + b^2$


# 3 Ways of Proving H => C

* Direct method: Assume that H is true by using logically correct steps, show that C is also true
* Proof by contrapositive: Assume ~C is true show that ~H is true
* Proof by contradiction: Assume ~C is true show that H is both true and false

# Division in Z

Given $a,b,c \in \mathbb{Z}, a \neq 0$

We say that if $a|b$ if $\exists c \in \mathbb{Z}$ s.t. $a=bc$

In this case, we say that a is a divisior of b 

divisor | dividend


# Even and Odd Numbers

In Z, a number is said to be even if $a = 2b$

a number is said to be odd if $a = 2b+1$

## Problem 

Show n odd in Z => n^2 is odd

n = (2k+1) 

n^2 = (2k+1)(2k+1) = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 = 2(2k^2+2k)+1 

therefore n^2 is odd
