$\forall A, |2^A|=2^{|A|}$

Solution: 
* Let the cardinality of $|A|=n$
* Then P(n) = If $|A| = n$ then $|P(A)| = 2^{n}$

### Proof

* $P(1): |A|=1 \implies A=\{a_1\} \implies P(A) = \{\{\emptyset\},\{a\}\} \implies |P(A)| = 2^1$
* Suppose $P(k): |A|=k, A=\{a_1,a_2,...,a_k\}$ where all $a_i$ are distinct, $|P(A)|=2^{k}$
* Let $B=\{a_1,a_2,...,a_k,a_{k+1}\}$, where all $a_i$ are distinct
* Then $|B| = k+1$

$B=\{a,b,c\}$

$P(B)=\{\emptyset, {a}, {b}, {a,b} \\
{c}, {a,c}, {c,b}, {c,a,b}
\}$

$P(B)$ is all subsets of A union all subsets of A with $a_{k+1}$ added.

$=\{C | C \subset A \lor C = D \cup \{a_{k+1}, D \subset A \}$

Then, $|2^B|=2^k+2^k = 2 * 2^k = 2^{k+1} = 2^{|B|}$

Therefore by PMI, P(n) is true for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$

### Example Problem

For two finite sets A and B, the cardinality of $|A \times B| = |A| \times |B|$


### Example: 

Show that $2^n \leq n!$ for $n \geq 4$

```latex
Modified/Shifted PMI:
* Let N be a natural number, let $P(n)$ be a statement involving $n \geq N$
```

* Let $P(n): 2^n \leq n!, \forall n \geq 4$
* $P(4) = 2^4 \leq 4!$
* Suppose $P(k): 2^k \leq k!, 4 \geq 4$
* Multiply both sides by $(k+1)$ This results in $2^k*2 \leq k!*2$
* $2^{k+1} \leq k!*2$
* $P(k+1): 2^{k+1} \leq k! * (k+1)$ when $k \geq 4$
* Therefore P(k+1) is true, by PMI P(n) is true for all n for n greater than or equal to 4.
